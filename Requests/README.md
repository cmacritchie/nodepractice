making http requests
you can use npm requests from npm
in this example you can use yargs to set up arguments with alia and then use request to get return values

so you put your address in for address argument then you can get the return values

request returns error, request, body values in the callback you can use those to figure out if the request worked and what to do with it

when using callbacks apis it is very usefult to abstract them, makes everything easier
