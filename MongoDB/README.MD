to start go to the root so usually
{user}/Program Files/MongoDB/Server/{version}
/bin has a bunch of tools that can be used.

create a new directory to tell where to store data,

usually go with users area or soemthing
so pretty much do this to connect to data:

{user}/Program Files/MongoDB/Server/{version}/bin/mongod.exe --dbpath /users{users}/{mongoDBFolder}
this sets it up

go to mongodb directory and run mongo.exe

robomongo is a nice gui
