we're going to use handlebars as a templating engine to use dynamic data, headers, footers, etc.
you can use pug or djs

handlebars is a view engine

you need to name html files .hbs

this example uses hbs but for future handlebars and hbs express may be good to try
use {{}} to insert arguments,
on the server side insert javascript for arguments
